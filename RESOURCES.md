# Resource Acquisition and Management

This document details the resource acquisition and management strategy within the Vulkan rendering system.

## Current Implementation

The `ResourceManager` class is responsible for creating and managing Vulkan resources, including buffers, images, and command pools.  It uses a caching mechanism to reuse resources where possible.  Key features include:

* **Resource Creation:** Methods for creating buffers and images with specified sizes, usages, and memory properties.
* **Memory Allocation:**  Utilizes the `MemoryAllocator` class to allocate device memory for resources.
* **Resource Tracking:**  Stores created resources in a dictionary for later cleanup.
* **Caching:**  Caches created resources based on their properties to avoid redundant creation.
* **Cleanup:**  Destroys all managed resources upon application termination.

## Areas for Improvement

* **Shader Modules:** Shader modules are currently loaded and managed by the `ShaderManager` but are not explicitly tracked by the `ResourceManager`.  This could be improved by integrating shader module management into the `ResourceManager`.
* **Descriptor Sets and Pools:** Descriptor sets and pools are created and managed within the `Swapchain` and `VulkanRenderer` classes.  Centralizing their management within the `ResourceManager` would improve consistency.
* **Pipelines:** Pipelines are created within the `Swapchain` class.  Managing them within the `ResourceManager` would provide better control and cleanup.
* **Synchronization Objects:** Semaphores and fences are created within the `RenderManager`.  These should also be managed by the `ResourceManager`.
* **Mesh Resources:**  Mesh vertex and index buffers are created within the `Mesh` component.  Moving this responsibility to the `ResourceManager` would improve resource lifecycle management.
* **More Aggressive Caching:**  The current caching mechanism is basic.  It could be extended to handle more resource types and variations.  Consider using a more sophisticated caching strategy, potentially with LRU eviction.

## Proposed Changes

To address the identified areas for improvement, the following changes are recommended:

1. **Extend ResourceManager:** Add methods for managing shader modules, descriptor sets/pools, pipelines, and synchronization objects.
2. **Refactor Resource Creation:** Move resource creation logic from other classes (e.g., `Swapchain`, `RenderManager`, `Mesh`) to the `ResourceManager`.
3. **Enhance Caching:** Implement a more robust caching mechanism to cover a wider range of resources and optimize resource reuse.
