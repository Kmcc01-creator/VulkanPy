# Lighting Improvement Goals

1. Implement basic Phong lighting model
   - Add ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components
   - Pass light position and properties to shaders

2. Support multiple light sources
   - Implement a system for managing multiple lights in the scene
   - Update shaders to handle multiple light sources

3. Add support for different light types
   - Point lights
   - Directional lights
   - Spot lights

4. Implement normal mapping for improved surface detail

5. Add shadow mapping for more realistic lighting

6. Implement global illumination techniques (future enhancement)

## Implementation Plan

1. Update Vertex structure to include normals
2. Modify shaders to implement Phong lighting model
3. Add uniform buffer objects (UBOs) for light properties
4. Update render pipeline to pass lighting information to shaders
5. Implement multiple light source support in shaders and C++ code
6. Add different light types and their respective calculations in shaders
7. Implement normal mapping (requires texture coordinates and tangent space calculations)
8. Add shadow mapping (requires depth map rendering and shadow calculations)

These improvements will significantly enhance the visual quality and realism of the rendered scene.
