# Refactoring Opportunities

## vulkan_app/src/vulkan_renderer.py

1. Separate Vulkan initialization:
   - Move Vulkan initialization code from `VulkanRenderer` to `VulkanEngine` to centralize Vulkan setup and avoid duplication.

2. Implement a proper command buffer pool:
   - Instead of creating new command buffers for each operation, implement a command buffer pool for better resource management and performance.

3. Centralize swapchain management:
   - Move all swapchain-related code to the `Swapchain` class to improve encapsulation and reduce duplication.

4. Implement proper resource management:
   - Use RAII principles or a dedicated resource manager consistently throughout the code to prevent memory leaks and ensure proper cleanup.

5. Separate rendering logic:
   - Move rendering logic from `VulkanRenderer` to a dedicated `Renderer` class to improve separation of concerns.

6. Implement a proper frame management system:
   - Replace the current frame management with a more robust system that handles multiple frames in flight.

## vulkan_app/src/input_handler.py

1. Implement an input mapping system:
   - Replace the current hard-coded input checks with a flexible input mapping system that allows for easy customization of controls.

2. Use a state-based input system:
   - Implement a state-based input system to handle both continuous and one-time input events more efficiently.

## General

1. Implement proper error handling:
   - Add comprehensive error checking and handling for all Vulkan operations.

2. Implement a logging system:
   - Add a logging system to facilitate debugging and provide better insight into the application's behavior.

3. Use type hints:
   - Add type hints throughout the codebase to improve readability and catch potential type-related errors early.

4. Implement unit tests:
   - Add unit tests for critical components to ensure reliability and ease future refactoring efforts.

5. Implement a configuration system:
   - Replace hard-coded values with a configuration system to allow for easy tweaking of application parameters.

6. Optimize ECS implementation:
   - Review and optimize the current ECS implementation to ensure it's performant and scalable for larger scenes.
