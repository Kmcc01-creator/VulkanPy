# Redundancies and Weak Points

## vulkan_app/src/vulkan_renderer.py

1. Redundant initialization of Vulkan components:
   - The `VulkanRenderer` class initializes many Vulkan components that are already handled by the `VulkanEngine` class. This leads to duplication of code and potential inconsistencies.

2. Duplicate command buffer creation:
   - The `record_command_buffer` method creates a new command buffer, but there's also a separate `copy_buffer` method that creates another command buffer. This could be consolidated.

3. Redundant cleanup code:
   - The `cleanup` method in `VulkanRenderer` duplicates cleanup operations that are likely already handled by the `VulkanEngine` class.

4. Multiple implementations of swapchain recreation:
   - There are references to swapchain recreation in both the `VulkanRenderer` and `VulkanEngine` classes, which could lead to inconsistencies.

## vulkan_app/src/input_handler.py

1. Redundant GLFW key checks:
   - The `process_input` method checks for key presses using individual `if` statements, which could be optimized.

## General

1. Lack of error handling:
   - Many Vulkan operations lack proper error checking and handling, which could lead to silent failures or crashes.

2. Inconsistent use of resource management:
   - Some parts of the code use a `ResourceManager`, while others manage Vulkan resources directly, leading to potential memory leaks and inconsistent cleanup.
