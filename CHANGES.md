   - Replaced individual key checks with a more efficient dictionary-based approach.

2. Improved error handling and logging in `vulkan_renderer.py`:
   - Added try-except blocks for Vulkan operations.
   - Enhanced logging for better debugging.

3. Removed redundant code in `vulkan_renderer.py`:
   - Deleted unused `copy_buffer` method.
   - Removed duplicate cleanup code that's already handled by `VulkanEngine`.

4. Enhanced resource management in `render_manager.py`:
   - Implemented proper cleanup for Vulkan resources.

5. Optimized mesh generation in `mesh_renderer.py`:
   - Improved efficiency of vertex and index generation for primitive shapes.

6. Updated shader management in `shader_manager.py`:
   - Added error handling for shader loading and compilation.

7. Improved type hinting throughout the codebase for better code readability and error catching.

8. Standardized logging across all files for consistent error reporting and debugging.

These changes aim to improve the overall performance, reliability, and maintainability of the codebase.
