# Project Notes: Vulkan Graphics Application

This document outlines areas for improvement and further development in the Vulkan graphics application.

## Weak Points and Areas for Improvement

* **Error Handling:**  Current error handling is minimal.  Implement more robust error checking and reporting for Vulkan function calls.  Use Vulkan validation layers for debugging.
* **Resource Management:** Resource cleanup is basic.  Implement a more comprehensive resource management system to prevent memory leaks and ensure efficient resource usage.  Consider using RAII principles or a custom resource manager.
* **Swapchain Recreation:** Swapchain recreation is triggered on resize, but could be more robust. Handle minimization and other edge cases.
* **Input Handling:** Input processing is rudimentary. Implement more sophisticated input handling for camera control, object manipulation, and other interactions.
* **Shader Management:** Shader loading and compilation is basic.  Implement a more flexible system for managing shaders, including hot reloading and compilation errors.
* **Abstraction:** The `VulkanRenderer` class is becoming large.  Consider further refactoring to separate concerns and improve code organization.
* **Vertex Data:**  Vertex data is hardcoded. Implement loading from external files (e.g., .obj) and support for different vertex attributes (normals, texture coordinates).
* **Scene Management:**  There's no scene management.  Implement a scene graph or other structure to organize and manage objects in the scene.
* **Transformations:**  Implement transformations (translation, rotation, scaling) for objects in the scene.
* **Material System:**  Implement a material system to define the appearance of objects.
* **Lighting:**  Implement lighting calculations (e.g., Phong shading) to illuminate the scene.
* **Texture Mapping:**  Implement texture mapping to add detail to objects.

## Features to Implement

* **Model Loading:** Load 3D models from files (e.g., .obj, .fbx).
* **Texturing:** Implement texture loading and mapping.
* **Lighting:** Implement basic lighting (directional, point, spot).
* **Shadows:** Implement shadow mapping for realistic shadows.
* **Post-processing:** Implement post-processing effects (e.g., bloom, depth of field).
* **GUI:** Integrate a GUI library (e.g., Dear ImGui) for user interface elements.

## Additional Notes

* Explore using a Vulkan SDK and validation layers for debugging and profiling.
* Consider using a build system (e.g., CMake) for easier project management.
* Investigate more advanced Vulkan features like compute shaders and ray tracing.
